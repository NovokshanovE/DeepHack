In the field of biomedical image analysis, the quest for architectures capable of effectively capturing long-range dependencies is paramount, especially when dealing with 3D image segmentation, classification, and landmark detection. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle with locality respective field, and Transformers have a heavy computational load when applied to high-dimensional medical <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://images.In" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> this paper, we introduce nnMamba, a novel architecture that integrates the strengths of CNNs and the advanced long-range modeling capabilities of State Space Sequence Models (SSMs). Specifically, we propose the Mamba-In-Convolution with Channel-Spatial Siamese learning (MICCSS) block to model the long-range relationship of the voxels. For the dense prediction and classification tasks, we also design the channel-scaling and channel-sequential learning methods. Extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate nnMamba's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in a suite of challenging tasks, including 3D image segmentation, classification, and landmark detection. nnMamba emerges as a robust solution, offering both the local representation ability of CNNs and the efficient global context processing of SSMs, setting a new standard for long-range dependency modeling in medical image analysis.
