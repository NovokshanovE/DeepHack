Materials discovery, especially for applications that require extreme operating conditions, requires extensive testing that naturally limits the ability to inquire the wealth of possible compositions. Machine Learning (ML) has nowadays a well established role in facilitating this effort in systematic ways. The increasing amount of available accurate DFT data represents a solid basis upon which new ML models can be trained and tested. While conventional models rely on static descriptors, generally suitable for a limited class of systems, the flexibility of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) allows for direct learning representations on graphs, such as the ones formed by crystals. We utilize crystal graph neural networks (CGNN) to predict crystal properties with DFT level accuracy, through graphs with encoding of the atomic (node/vertex), bond (edge), and global state attributes. In this work, we aim at testing the ability of the CGNN MegNet framework in predicting a number of properties of systems previously unseen from the model, obtained by adding a substitutional defect in bulk crystals that are included in the training set. We perform DFT validation to assess the accuracy in the prediction of formation energies and structural features (such as elastic moduli). Using CGNNs, one may identify promising paths in alloy discovery.
