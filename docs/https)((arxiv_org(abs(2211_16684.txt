Machine Learning (ML) interatomic models and potentials have been widely employed in simulations of materials. Long-range interactions often dominate in some ionic systems whose dynamics behavior is significantly influenced. However, the long-range effect such as Coulomb and Van der Wales potential is not considered in most ML interatomic potentials. To address this issue, we put forward a method that can take long-range effects into account for most ML local interatomic models with the reciprocal space neural network. The structure information in real space is firstly transformed into reciprocal space and then encoded into a reciprocal space potential or a global descriptor with full atomic interactions. The reciprocal space potential and descriptor keep full invariance of Euclidean symmetry and choice of the cell. Benefiting from the reciprocal-space information, ML interatomic models can be extended to describe the long-range potential including not only Coulomb but any other long-range interaction. A model NaCl system considering Coulomb interaction and the GaxNy system with defects are applied to illustrate the advantage of our approach. At the same time, our approach helps to improve the prediction accuracy of some global properties such as the band gap where the full atomic interaction beyond local atomic environments plays a very important role. In summary, our work has expanded the ability of current ML interatomic models and potentials when dealing with the long-range effect, hence paving a new way for accurate prediction of global properties and large-scale dynamic simulations of systems with defects.
