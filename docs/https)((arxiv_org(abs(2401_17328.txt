Cardiovascular disease remains a leading global cause of mortality, necessitating accurate risk prediction tools. Traditional methods, such as QRISK and the Framingham heart score, exhibit limitations in their ability to incorporate comprehensive patient data, potentially resulting in incomplete risk factor consideration. To address these shortcomings, this study conducts a meticulous review focusing on the application of machine learning models to enhance predictive accuracy. Machine learning models, such as support vector machines, and Random Forest, as well as deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have emerged as promising alternatives. These models offer superior performance, accommodating a broader spectrum of variables and providing precise subgroup-specific predictions. While machine learning integration holds promise for enhancing risk assessment, it presents challenges such as data requirements and computational constraints. Additionally, large language models have revolutionised healthcare applications, augmenting diagnostic precision and patient care. This study examines the core aspects of cardiovascular disease event risk and presents a thorough review of traditional and machine learning models, alongside deep learning techniques, for improved accuracy. It offers a comprehensive survey of relevant datasets, critically compares ML models with conventional approaches, and synthesizes key findings, highlighting their implications for clinical practice. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning and large language models in cardiovascular medicine is undeniable. However, rigorous validation and optimisation are imperative before widespread application in healthcare. This integration promises more accurate and personalised cardiovascular care.
